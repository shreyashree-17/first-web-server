# "First Web Server"

Welcome to my first web server project created using Node.js and NPM! This basic server will get me started on my journey to understanding web development. I've included some essential dependencies like date-fns, uuid, and nodemon to help me along the way.

## Getting Started

To run the server, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Git Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine. 

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required dependencies. Use the following command:
```sh
npm install
```

This command will download and install the necessary packages specified in the `package.json` file.

3. **Start the Server**: Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the server using the following command:
```sh
npm run dev
```

This command will run the server using `nodemon`, which will automatically restart the server whenever you make changes to the code.

4. **Access the Server**: With the server up and running, you can access it by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3500`. You should see your basic web server in action!

## Project Dependencies

### 1. `date-fns`

[date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for manipulating and formatting dates and times. In this project, you can leverage this library to handle date-related functionality.

### 2. `uuid`

[uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) is a library for generating universally unique identifiers (UUIDs). You can use UUIDs to create unique identifiers for various resources or entities in your application.

### 3. `nodemon`

[nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) is a utility that helps develop Node.js-based applications by automatically restarting the server when code changes are detected. This makes the development process much more efficient and convenient.
